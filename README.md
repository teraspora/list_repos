# List a User's Github repositories (names and URLs)

A simple Python script to get a JSON file listing a given user's repositories 
(well, the first 1000 of them) using the Github API, and listing the names and URLs in the terminal.)

With most terminal applications, of course, these URLs can be Ctrl+click-ed / Command+click-ed to open them in a new page of the default browser.
